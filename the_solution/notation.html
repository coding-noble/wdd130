                <p>The very first step in solving a Rubik's cube is to understand and know each of its many parts. The Rubik's cube has six sides and they are known as faces, each face is made up of nine stickers of the same color making a total of 52 stickers in all. There are three different types of pieces that make up the cube. Center pieces, with only one sticker, edge pieces with two stickers, and corner pieces with the most at three stickers each.</p>

                <p>When you hold the cube, you will want to pick one color to be the bottom face. This is known as the down face and is represented by the letter “D”. The face on top is your 'Up face', which is represented by a U. The faces in your right and left hand are represented by the letters 'R' and 'L' respectively and the back and front faces by the letter “B” and the letter “F”. Each of these letters represents which side you will turn clockwise unless there is an apostrophe after it then it will be counterclockwise. For example, if you see (R L R') you will turn the right face clockwise followed by the left face clockwise, and end with the right face counterclockwise. If there is a two after a letter you simply turn that face two times.</p>

                    <p>Each set of letters that represent a series of turns is known as an algorithm. You will learn and memorize many algorithms as you practice solving the Rubik's cube. Here are some algorithms that you can practice with if you feel that you are not ready to read the more complex ones.</p>
