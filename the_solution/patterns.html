                    <p>This site will help all those who are interested in solving the iconic Rubik's cube. Many people think that it's a lot
                        harder than it really is, and by following the steps described on this website anyone can learn to master the cube.
                        <p>
                        Each step, in learning to solve the Rubik's cube is essential and if you are a beginner, we recommend starting by learning
                        <a href="">standard cube notation</a>. This step will help you learn what each part of the Rubik's cube is called as
                        well as how we reference them when reading algorithms.

                    <p>If you already know standard cube notation and just want to jump right into solving the Rubik's cube, head over to the
                        <a href="">solutions page</a>. There you will learn every step in a standard method of solving the Rubik's cube,
                        it may not be the fastest method out there, but it gets the job done and if you practice enough, you can even get times
                        under thirty seconds.
                        <p>
                        Once you have mastered solving the Rubik's cube and are looking for a challenge try putting the Cube into one of the unique
                        designs found on the <a href="">patterns page</a>. This can be a great way to practice reading cube notation and looks
                        great when you're done.
