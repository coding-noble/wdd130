            Hello, my name is Miles Noble, I'm 21 years old, and I'm super excited to learn with you guys this semester.
            I have been homeschooled all my life except for one semester during eighth grade when I attended a privet
            school and decided that it was not my thing. I have been a member of the church my hole life and served a
            mission In Fort Worth and Dallas Texas during 2019 - 2021 which was a strange time to serve a mission to say
            the least, but I loved it all the same. I'm currently living in Vancouver Canada, but I'm originally from
            Cora Wyoming, witch is a very small town that no one has ever heard of before. I'm currently studying to
            become a software engineer, I'm taking this class because I want to expand my front-end coding knowledge,
            I have done work with back-end coding and I think that's where my true passion is, but in my opinion it's
            always good to know more.
